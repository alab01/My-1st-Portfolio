# My-1st-Portfolio

## The motivation for this project is to complete the requirments of the second challenge the class was presented with. The challenge being, making the first iteration of our portfolio. Seeing as we havent completed any major projects we were instructed to just complete the styling and boxes where are future works will reside. I will eventually be updating this portfolio as I learn more and complete different projects. This is a basic portfolio that will be worked on throughout the rest of the course.
